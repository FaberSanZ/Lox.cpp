 ## C++ implementation of [Lox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters)
</h1>


I'm reading [Crafting Interpreters book](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) by
Bob Nystrom and writing Lox interpreter in C++ as I do this (the original code
in the book is written in Java and some is in C). It's fun!
